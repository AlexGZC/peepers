<h1>Peepers</h1>

<p>Peepers is a simple IP camera application for Android 2.3.3. Images from the
device's camera are streamed to a client using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG">Motion
JPEG</a> over HTTP. Peepers is designed
to be educational and, as such, does not have many features (feel free to add
some). Peepers is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. See
<code>$REPO/LICENSE.txt</code> for more information.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>You'll need to <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html">setup the Android
SDK</a> and configure your
system for Android development. If you're using Arch Linux, you can run</p>

<pre><code># $REPO/scripts/setup-arch.sh -a
</code></pre>

<p>to install the required packages and configure your system. Read and understand
this script before running it: it's quite invasive.</p>

<h2>Build and install</h2>

<p>To build and install Peepers, run</p>

<pre><code># $REPO/scripts/build.sh -bi
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>build.sh</code> with <code>-h</code> for more information. Alternatively, you can
convert Peepers into an Android Eclipse project.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Start Peepers on an Android device that is connected to a network. Peepers will
show the device's URL in the top-left of the screen. Then view the stream using
one of the methods below.</p>

<h3>Client test page</h3>

<p>Open the client test page with a web browser.</p>

<pre><code># $BROWSER $REPO/client/minimal.html
</code></pre>

<p>and enter the device's URL into the text box.</p>

<p>So far, this has proven to be the most reliable way to view the stream. To
include the stream in your own page, just add</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyyy/"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>VLC</h3>

<p>VLC will allow you to, among other things, record the stream.</p>

<pre><code># vlc http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyyy/
</code></pre>

<h3>Direct to browser</h3>

<p>This is the dirtiest method. This has been tested on Chromium Version
24.0.1312.70, but it's a bit laggy.</p>

<p>Open a web browser and navigate to</p>

<pre><code>http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyyy/
</code></pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>You can change the port and JPEG quality from the settings screen.</p></li>
<li><p>The port must be between 1024 and 65535.</p></li>
<li><p>The JPEG quality must be between 0 and 100.</p></li>
<li><p>While streaming, Peepers logs the average frames per second over the last
fifty frames.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Webcam streamer</h2>

<p>Webcam streamer (in <code>$REPO/tools/webcam-streamer</code>) is a pure Java (i.e.,
it doesn't depend on the Android SDK) implementation of Motion JPEG of HTTP. It
uses a webcam as it's source. Both the Android application and this tool
share the same <code>MJpegHttpStreamer.java</code> file. So, you can change and test the
underlying streaming code without having to worry about Android.</p>

<p>To run the tool, <code>cd</code> into the <code>webcam-streamer</code> directory and run</p>

<pre><code># ant run
</code></pre>

<p>While the tool is running, the stream should be available at
<code>http://localhost:8080/</code>.</p>
